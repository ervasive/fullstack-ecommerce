# Fullstack Ecommerce Example

This monorepo contains the source code for a sample project for stock management and ecommerce application. It is built using the following stack of tools and technologies:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Main datastore and business logic layer.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Thin backend server for handling requests and passing them to the GraphQL API endpoint.
- [PostGraphile](https://postgraphile.org/) - Builds an extensible and high-performance GraphQL API based on the underlying database schema.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React.js](https://react.dev/) - Decoupled applications providing web UI for presentation and user interactions with the data.

The monorepo is managed with [NX](https://nx.dev/)

**Status**: Work In Progress

**Disclaimer**: The main goal of the project is to learn and dive into the stack. It is not intended for production use.
